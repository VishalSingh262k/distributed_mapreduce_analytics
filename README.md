This project implements a distributed data analytics pipeline for large-scale wine quality feature analysis. The system integrates MapReduce batch processing, Spark-based distributed computation, synthetic big data generation, and a production-style Streamlit monitoring dashboard. The pipeline demonstrates real-world data engineering workflow design including distributed aggregation, feature ranking, and visualization layers.
